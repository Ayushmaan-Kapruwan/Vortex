\section*{Abstract}
Modern PC gamers often maintain game libraries across multiple platforms such as Steam, Epic Games, and GOG. 
This fragmentation limits visibility into playtime, achievements, system compatibility, and usage patterns.
Vortex proposes a unified game library and launcher that aggregates metadata from multiple platforms and provides
advanced tracking, performance insights, and intelligent recommendations. 
The project aims to explore system integration, data aggregation, and user-centric analytics within a desktop application.
